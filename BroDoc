Day 1:

    Setting up RSA key :

        1) ssh-keygen -> used to make id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
        These keys are used to make ssh connection.

        2) Setup ssh connection
        ssh user@ip -> used to ssh into a server

        #### COMMANDS THAT WE RAN ####
        
        (-1) sudo pacman -S net-tools
        -> was made to see the network information

        (0) ifconfig | grep inet
        -> returns the inet address..... in short the IP

        (1) sudo systemctl status sshd.services
        -> Was used to check if the port was made active for ssh
        
        (2) sudo systemctl start sshd.services
        -> was used to make the port 22 active for ssh

        (3) VOLA!!!! we can now ssh
        -> ssh janhvi@192.168.208.13
        -> we had successfully ssh into Jan's server
        -> the ssh (Shrinija)
        -> The server being us (Shr) and also the client (Jan).

        (4) ran some commands.... tmux a
        -> After a playful day we had stopped the the ssh port

        (5) sudo systemctl stop sshd.services
        -> used to stop the port 22 (security)
        

Day 2:

        ### SETTING UP QEMU ###

        1) WHY QEMU....?
        -> It is used to emulate the architecture. of the system
        -> Arch's being -> x86_64, ARM, ARCH....

        2) WHY KVM..?
        -> Hypervisor. (It is used to virtualize the system resources)

        3) Downloading Alpine OS 
        -> Why alpine? lightweight, small in size and have secure (based on musl and busybox)?
        
        4) qemu-system-x86_64 -hda <img-path> -m 4G -smp 2
        -> this command is used to setup the img, img being alpine with 4G of ram and 2 cores being allocated

        5) setup-alpine
            -> root user setup
            -> network drivers [eth0]
            -> setting up the disk space
            -> Enter(w/o knwoing)

        6) Adding deps
        -> Setting up environment
            -> python -m venv <env-name>
            -> source ./bin/activate
        -> python, pip, numpy, pillow, opencv

        7) SSH from client to server
        -> scp -r /path/to/file root@ip:/path/at/server
